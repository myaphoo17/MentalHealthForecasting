# FirstDive in R with Shiny: Global Mental Health Disorder Trends and Predictions

This repository contains a **Shiny app** for visualizing global mental health disorder trends and predicting future rates. The app processes data for **schizophrenia**, **depression**, **anxiety**, **bipolar**, and **eating disorders** across multiple countries over time.

## Key Features:
- **Trend Visualizations**: Interactive line charts showing the trends of mental health disorders by year.
- **Prediction Models**: Uses linear regression to predict future trends for selected disorders.
- **Interactive Selection**: Select countries and disorders dynamically via dropdowns.
- **Downloadable Graphs**: Option to download visualizations in PNG, JPG, and PDF formats.
- **Summary Statistics**: Statistical summaries for the selected disorder and country.

## Fun Fact:
This dataset is from 2020, so if you select **Myanmar**, you may see a significant improvement in mental health trends. However, this does not reflect the current reality, and the actual mental health situation in Myanmar may be much worse due to ongoing challenges.


Stay tuned for future enhancements!
